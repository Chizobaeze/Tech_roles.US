In this project:
The dataset I obtained from Kaggle includes data such as job postings in certain tech_roles, the annual_base_pay, the experience when working in the company and the total years of experience of all the individuals.


Data cleaning and organizing using Python and pandas.
Database management and queries, as sorting out just the US file on some data, using SQL server.
